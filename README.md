# STANCE DETECTION FROM TWITTER TWEETS

The user stance detection problem is one where, based upon user-generated content, a system needs to understand the opinion polarity of the user with respect to a topic addressed in the content.The opinion polarity is often expressed in form of discrete class labels, e.g., positive or favor, negative or against, and neutral or none.

Example:

    Target : Demonetization

    Tweet : #Demonetization has long term benefits. Pain now is  temporary. Let us help #nation to make #India #corruption free.

    Stance : FAVOUR
